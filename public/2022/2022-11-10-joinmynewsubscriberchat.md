Today I'm announcing a brand new addition to my Substack publication: the Democratizing Automation subscriber chat.

**I want to use this to discuss...**

-   **ideas in the works, or**

-   **ideas that didn't make it to a complete post, or**

-   **subscriber questions.**

This is a conversation space in the Substack app that I set up exclusively for my subscribers --- kind of like a group chat or live hangout. I'll post short prompts, thoughts, and updates that come my way, and you can jump into the discussion.

To join our chat, you'll need to download the Substack app (messages are sent via the app, not email). Turn on push notifications so you don't miss a chance to join conversation as it happens.

## How to get started

1.  **Download the app by clicking [this link](https://substack.com/app/app-store-redirect) or the button below.** Chat is only on iOS for now, but chat is coming to the Android app soon.

<!-- -->

2.  **Open the app and tap the Chat icon.** It looks like two bubbles in the bottom bar, and you'll see a row for my chat inside.
