It's been a bit since you've gotten some content. I've recently produced content again that *could* fit on this site, but has not landed here. Hopefully this shows you that I am building again rather than just saying that I am.

In brief, here are the two recent directions that would interest folks here.

**I finished my Ph.D. and got a job.**

You can read about my job search and the landscape of machine learning research jobs here. I now work at [HuggingFace](https://hf.co/) ðŸ¤—. \[blog [link](https://www.natolambert.com/writing/ai-phd-job-hunt)\]

It really seems like the job market and broader economic climate of machine learning is continuing to rage on. There's a trend where whenever a "groundbreaking" model is released, there is commentary on the long-tail of specific applications this one model will enable. Zooming out to a 5 year view, we see these tools in text generation, text analysis, image generation, and more. It is certainly moving towards a creative suite of automated world building.

I've also been lucky to start contributing directly in this area (to [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers)). It moves *way faster* than even reinforcement learning research would. There's huge broader appeal outside of just those with technical know-how. With this large appeal comes increased potential risk of abuse. Fitting with my history, I've managed to position myself in an exciting role of being a bridge between open source and ethics discussions of these models at HuggingFace. \[[Stable Diffusion / Diffusers blog link](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion)\]

I'll share the most exciting and high level takeaways here that are specific to me, but you can expect a lot of content to be written on this subject at the HuggingFace blog. We've started a "seasonal" newsletter on our ethics happenings and thoughts, I think you all would really enjoy it.

I'll send the link to them in my next post here or on twitter, so you don't have to worry about missing one. \[[Ethics @ HF blog link](https://huggingface.co/blog/ethics-soc-1)\]

**Some things in the pipeline.**

Some things I have been thinking about for a while are taking the shape of blog posts:

1.  Building on my piece *[How all machine learning becomes reinforcement learning](https://robotic.substack.com/p/ml-becomes-rl)*, I am working on continuing this direction. There is a ton of work in natural language processing trying to asses the temporal capabilities of large language models[1](#footnote-1){#footnote-anchor-1 .footnote-anchor component-name="FootnoteAnchorToDOM" target="_self"}. This is really exciting for someone who loves the reinforcement learning (RL) framing of sequential decisions in a partially observed environment, so I have a lot of thoughts to share.\
    \
    This blog post will be in synergy with a project going on at HuggingFace: [Online Language Model](https://twitter.com/TristanThrush/status/1557403968195596288).

2.  I'm digging into the weeds on how evaluation is done in RL. There's a lot to be said about what the limitations of the current environments are in terms of the engineering systems they inspire us to create.\
    \
    We have more coming from HuggingFace on this point too, where hopefully we can help the field overcome those limitations.

If you're interested, leave a comment.

you can read some literature review we put together [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q9LOj4DJEOAnUhGNJPmYXy0Wp56U1sOnrAOdWqh-ovI/edit#heading=h.dqjw7gw6z3ji), if you can't wait for me to put it together for you.
